Interactive Dashboard Using Tableau

Business Context:
Game Arena is a website that provides information about video games. It keeps track of the games that have 
been released and their sales across various platforms and genres. Different genres, such as RPGs, shooters, multiplayer, action, 
and so on, would appeal to different audiences. Game Arena has now implemented a feature on their website that allows 
gamers to subscribe to their platform on a month-to-month basis. They can play a limited number of games as long as they have a 
subscription.

Objetive:
As an analyt, I must design an interactive dashboard that helps the director of the company make a decision
on a new sales model (a subscription model) that will attract more gamers to our platform. There are multiple questions to be
answered in order to make the decision on the subscription model. For example, which games need to be given for the
subscription and what would be the duration?
